Tool to view Azure Storage Tables on iOS

Microsoft has launched its mighty free App Azure Storage Explorer to manage Azure Table Storage Accounts on Windows, Linux and Mac.

However I could not find an App on the Apple App Store which could be used to view and edit Azure Storage Tables on iPhone and iPad.
There is an open source iOS App on GitHub by Chris Risner
https://github.com/ChrisRisner/AzureStorageExplorer
However this App is actually not available on the App Store. 
So I decided to make an App by myself and make it available on the App Store under this link: https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/azuretabstorclient/id1399683806?mt=8
More information can be seen on this site:

The App is not free, so  not the complete code will be shown here on GitHub.
However in the next week some code snippets will be shown here as examples how things were done.
